- In Java, the Map interface is a part of the Java Collections Framework that represents a mapping between a set of keys
and their corresponding values.

- It is used to store key-value pairs where each key is unique and the values can be retrieved based on their corresponding keys.

- The Map interface provides various methods to manipulate the elements in the map, such as adding, removing, and modifying key-value pairs.

- The Map interface is implemented by several classes in the Java API, such as:
     1) HashMap,- Keys & Values will be stored in random order.
     2) TreeMap,- Keys & Values will be stored in ascending order.
     #) LinkedHashMap,- Keys & Values will be stored in entry order. 
     4) Hashtable.- Keys & Values will be stored in random order.
     
- Each of these classes provides different implementations of the Map interface and is suitable for different use cases depending on the specific requirements.

- Difference between Hashtable and Hashmap is:
    Hashtable: Synchronised, so no null value can be assigned for K or V
    
    Hashtable: Asynchronised, so null value can be assigned for K or V
