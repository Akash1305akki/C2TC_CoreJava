- Queue is a form of collection which supports the principle of FIFO(First- In-First-Out).

- Which means if you want to remove the last element of an array under queve interface you need to remove all other elements placed before it.u

- Size is constant and declared during initialization.

- Values are removed from front end and inserted from rear end of the array.

- To insert a element we use enQueue and remove a element we use deQueue.

- deQueue is also used to print the first element in collection.

Priority Queue:-
- Unlike queue these are different type of collection whose elements are sorted in a pre-prioritized order (ascending).

- They will not follow the order of insertion.

Array Deque:-
- It provides implementation of all methods in queue and dequeue interfaces.
