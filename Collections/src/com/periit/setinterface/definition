- In Java, a set interface is a type of collection that represents a group of unique elements.
 
- It is part of the Java Collections Framework and defines a set of methods that can be used to manipulate
a collection of elements, such as adding or removing elements, testing for membership,
and performing set operations such as intersection, union, and difference.

- The Set interface extends the Collection interface and specifies that each element in the set must be unique.

- That is, a set cannot contain any duplicate elements.

- It is implemented by several classes in the Java API, such as:
     1) HashSet.
     2) LinkedHashSet.
     3) TreeSet.
