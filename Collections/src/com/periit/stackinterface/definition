- In Java, a stack interface is a type of collection that represents a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure.

- It is part of the Java Collections Framework and defines a set of methods that can be used to manipulate a stack of elements,
such as adding or removing elements, peeking at the top element, and testing for empty stack.

- The Stack interface extends the Vector class and specifies that each element in the stack
is inserted and removed at the top of the stack.

- That is, the most recently added element is always at the top of the stack and the oldest element is at the bottom.

- It is implemented by several classes in the Java API, such as Stack and ArrayDeque.
