EXCEPTIONS:-

Exceptions are error's and events that occurs during program execution.
Arise of exceptions lead to missing or mis-matched output

2 types of exceptions in java:checked and unchecked exceptions.

 Checked exceptions are those that are checked at compile-time and must be handled by the program
 or declared to be thrown by the method in which they occur.

 Unchecked exceptions, on the other hand, are not checked at compile-time
 and are usually caused by programming errors or unexpected conditions.
 
 Example:-
 
 Input:-
 
 public class Main {
  public static void main(String[ ] args) {
    int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3};
    System.out.println(myNumbers[10]); // error!
  }
}

Output:-

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 10
        at Main.main(Main.java:4)
