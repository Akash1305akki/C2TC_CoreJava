- A lambda expression in Java is a shorthand way to write anonymous functions.

- Here's an example of a simple lambda expression that takes two integers and
returns their sum:

syntax:-
(int a, int b) -> a + b

("passing parameters") -> {"Statements to be executed"}

- This lambda expression can be assigned to a functional interface that has
a single abstract method with two integer parameters and an integer return type,
such as IntBinaryOperator.

- Here's an example of using this lambda expression to create a IntBinaryOperator instance:

IntBinaryOperator sum = (int a, int b) -> a + b;
