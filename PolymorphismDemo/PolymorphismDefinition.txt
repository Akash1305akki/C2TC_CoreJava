- A concept by which we can perform a single action in different
ways.

- Polymorphism means many forms.

- There are two ways in which polymorphism is implemented in Java.

         1) Method Overloading

         2) Method Overriding
         
 1) Method Overloading
 
 - A class has multiple methods having same name but different in
parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.

- Advantage : increases the readability of the program

- Two ways to overload the method in java

- By changing number of arguments

- By changing the data type

Note : Method Overloading is not possible by changing the return
type of the method only.

2) Method Overriding

- Subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent
class

- If a subclass provides the specific implementation of the method that
has been declared by one of its parent class, it is known as method
overriding.

rules:-
- The method must have the same name as in the parent class

- The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.

- There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance).
