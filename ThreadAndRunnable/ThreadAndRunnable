Threads allows a program to operate more efficiently 
by doing multiple things at the same time.

Threads can be used to perform complicated tasks 
in the background without interrupting the main program.

There are two ways to create a thread.

 -By "extends" keyword we can call the Thread Class.
 
 public class Main extends Thread {
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
  }
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------
 -By "implements" keyword we can call the Runnable Interface.
 
 public class Main implements Runnable {
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
  }
}
